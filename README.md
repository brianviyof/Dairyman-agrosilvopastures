# Hello-world
Being an agroforestry with keen interest in dairy farming, I have initiated a dairy farm project in Cameroon located at the Upper Farms prisions in Buea-SW region. The focus is to empower inmates with skills and make them more productive and be able to generate income when they leave prsion. The Dairy farming project focuses on developing agrosilvopastures and we involve other smallholder dairy farmers in the NW region. Here, we train farmers how to grow healthy pastures, grow maize for silage and produce high quality milk. Developing a sustainable dairy value chain for poor communities using areas were Heifer Project International failed to address. We are reorganizing diary farmers and their ativities to meet the demands of national and international markets according to ISO standards.
